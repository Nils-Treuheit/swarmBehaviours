# Swarm Behaviours
This is a repository where we are going to share our swarm behaviour implementations.

In the helpful_links.txt we going to post links to websites, videos or documents, that can help us figuring out how to implement the behaviours.
This behaviours will all be implemented assuming that we have an interface to receive the needed data.
This will help migrating the code later on to the actual Software Project.
