before generating new html output with doxygen do following:

	1. take all files in "commentedFiles" directory and past them in your paparazzi folder in their folder (to generate full documentation with my comments in it)
	2. take Doxyfile to import doxygen settings 
	3. generate output
	4. when everything is in the documentation upload it to this git
