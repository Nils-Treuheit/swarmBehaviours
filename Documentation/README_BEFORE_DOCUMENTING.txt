before generating new html output with doxygen do following:

	1. take all files in "commentedFiles" directory and paste them in your paparazzi folder in their folder (to generate full documentation with every comment in it)
        2. take your commented files and add them to the "commentedFiles" folder
	3. take Doxyfile to import doxygen settings and run generator (run: "doxygen -g Doxyfile" in "Documentation" folder )
	4. check documentation and upload it to this git when eveything looks great
